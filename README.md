# javaee-in28minutes-course
This repository keeps track of the files I created following a JavaEE course.

My intention doing this course was to refresh the Java syntax and learn the structure of a basic JavaEE aplication.
I have learned the JavaEE MVC system using servlets and jsp, the use of filters, routing, and how to manage dependencies using Maven among other things.

I like the way things are organized using JavaEE and I would like to get deep in this tecnology.
